# Webform

The Webform module for DrupalGap. When viewing a webform enabled node in
DrupalGap, this module will automatically display the webform in the app.

## Installation

Download and enable the 7.x-4.x version of the Webform Service module:

- https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_service

## Configuration

Then in Drupal, go to `admin/structure/services/list/drupalgap/resources` and
enable your desired service resources under *webforms* and *submissions*:

 - submission
 -- create
 -- retrieve
 -- update
 -- delete
 - webform
 -- create
 -- retrieve
 -- update
 -- delete
 -- index
 -- submissions

Then in Drupal, go to admin/structure/services/list/drupalgap/resources and
enable your desired service resources under "webforms" and "submissions". We
recommend enabling at least the "create", "retrieve" and "index" resources.

Visit the `admin/people/permissions` page in Drupal, and review the permissions
you have set for Webform module. That will give you a better idea of what
service resources you should consider enabling.

After enabling the service resources, it's a good idea to the clear all the
caches in Drupal.
